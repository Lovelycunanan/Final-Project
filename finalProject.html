    <h2>A bit about me</h2>
    <p id="typed-text">
        I'm a software development student with a big dream of becoming a software engineer. I'm
        passionate about coding and creating innovative solutions that make a difference in people's
        lives. I'm looking for possibilities to work with software development company that appreciate
        innovation, cooperation, and ongoing learning as I continue to advance my knowledge and
        skills in this field. I am currently learning programming languages
        including JavaScript, C++,
        HTML, and CSS. I'm enthusiastic to contribute to initiatives that advance technology and
        deliver exceptional user experiences. I thrive in fast-paced environments, where problem-
        solving and teamwork are at the core. I'm always up for a challenge and love the satisfaction of
        turning complex problems into elegant, efficient solutions.
