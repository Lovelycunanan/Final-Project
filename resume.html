        <h1>Experiences</h1>

        <p>
            <em>Sunvalley Kids Academy Montessori, 2022 - 2023</em> - I have gained valuable 
        experience in creating a nurturing and educational atmosphere for young 
        children as a committed daycare teacher. I have developed my abilities 
        in child development throughout my profession and used age-appropriate 
        activities to support their physical, mental, and social development. 
        My priority has always been the children's safety and protection; I 
        regularly updated parents on their child's development and responded to 
        any worries or queries they might have had. My job as a daycare teacher 
        required a lot of cooperation and coordination. I actively worked with 
        other teachers and staff to provide a unified and encouraging environment 
        for the kids.

        <p>
            <em>VP of Finance, Junior Achievement, 2020</em> - In my role as Junior 
            Achievement's vice president of finance, I was responsible for timely 
            and accurate financial reporting, forecasting, and budgeting. I was 
            essential in creating and implementing the financial plans that supported 
            the company's ambitions. This required performing in-depth financial 
            research, locating opportunities for cost optimization, and providing the 
            team with recommendations that were well-informed. In order to support 
            strategic decision-making, I offered financial insights and direction. As 
            Vice President of Finance, collaboration and clear communication were 
            essential components of my job. During the presentation of the reports, 
            the exchange of ideas, and the interaction with customers, I was able to 
            improve my public speaking abilities.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Coached Volleyball, Windsor Park Collegiate, 2020</em> - I created and put 
            into practice training plans that emphasize skill development, teamwork, 
            and sportsmanship during my brief time as a volleyball coach. I came up 
            with practice plans that include drills and activities to hone the 
            fundamentals of hitting, passing, serving, and setting. On the court, I 
            have also stressed the value of strategy, game awareness, and efficient 
            communication. I encouraged the young athletes to behave in a respectful, 
            orderly, and committed manner. I've inspired athletes to push themselves 
            and aim for perfection via encouraging feedback and constructive criticism. 
            I've also instilled values like teamwork and sportsmanship; giving them 
            the tools they need to succeed on and off the court.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Intern, PCL Construction, 2019</em> - During my internship as a civil 
            engineer, I was able to get practical knowledge in a variety of areas of 
            the industry. On a variety of projects, including site inspections, design 
            development, and construction management, I collaborated closely with a 
            group of professional engineers. I gained knowledge on how to analyze and 
            evaluate technical drawings in order to ensure adherence to rules and 
            regulations. Additionally, I got the opportunity to take part in site 
            visits and inspections where I watched and learned about various building 
            methods and materials. I was able to comprehend the practical application 
            of engineering principles as well as the significance of efficient project 
            management thanks to this experience.
