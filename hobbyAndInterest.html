            My journey with volleyball began in grade school at Victor Mager School, 
            where I first discovered my passion for the sport. It was there that I 
            honed my skills, learned the intricacies of teamwork, and developed a love 
            for the fast-paced nature of the game. As I progressed to Windsor Park 
            Collegiate for high school, my commitment to volleyball deepened. 
            Representing my high school team allowed me to compete at a more competitive 
            level, where I continued to refine my techniques and embrace the camaraderie 
            of the sport. Even after high school, I carried my love for volleyball into 
            the realm of recreational play, participating in friendly matches for the 
            sheer joy and camaraderie that the game brings. Beyond the structured 
            environments of school competition, playing volleyball for fun has allowed me 
            to sustain the connection to a sport that has been an integral part of my 
            personal and athletic journey.

            I discovered my love for singing at a young age, and it quickly became a 
            passion that I've carried with me throughout my life. From volunteering events 
            to school functions and even weddings, I have had the joy of sharing my voice 
            in various settings. These experiences not only allowed me to express my 
            musicality but also brought a sense of fulfillment as I contributed my talent 
            to meaningful moments and celebrations. Singing has been a constant thread in 
            the fabric of my life, weaving through diverse occasions and connecting me with 
            others through the shared joy of music.

        <p>
            My exploration of the guitar commenced as a casual interest that blossomed into 
            a fulfilling musical endeavor. Starting with the basics, I dedicated time to 
            learning chords and mastering the instrument's techniques. Playing the guitar 
            quickly became a source of solace and self-expression, allowing me to convey 
            emotions and tell stories through music. From strumming familiar tunes to 
            experimenting with my compositions, each chord and melody has been a step in my 
            musical evolution. The guitar, for me, is not just an instrument; it's a 
            companion in my creative journey, offering a unique channel for personal 
            expression and a constant source of joy.
